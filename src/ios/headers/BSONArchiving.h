 This protocol can be adopted by custom class if you'd like to save/retrieve objects other than the supported types.
 You must implement all three methods in order for this to work. Please note: only supported objects can be saved
 from the object. What this means is, you can't provide a property that is for instance, an NSSet as it will
 not be recognized as a supported type (in fact, the code will throw an exception if you do so).
